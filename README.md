# Payload CMS with MongoDB

This is a PayloadCMS with MongoDB Website Template designed to power websites, blogs, or portfolios ranging from small projects to enterprise-level applications. This repository includes a fully functional backend, an enterprise-grade admin panel, and a beautifully designed, production-ready website.

## Quick Start

### Deploying to EdgeOne Pages

1. Prepare the necessary environment variables:
   1. **DATABASE_URI**: Your MongoDB connection string like:
     ```
     mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```
   2. **PAYLOAD_SECRET**: This should be a long, unguessable, strong password. You can use a password manager to generate one. For example, run:
     ```
     openssl rand -base64 32
     ```
   3. **NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL**: Your website URL like: `https://payload-mongodb-starter.edgeone.app`
   4. **PREVIEW_SECRET**: Used to validate preview requests

      **S3 configuration settings are used to store uploaded files, such as blog cover images.**
   5. **S3_BUCKET**
   6. **S3_REGION**
   7. **S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID**
   8. **S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**
   9. **S3_ENDPOINT**

2. One-click deployment to EdgeOne Pages:

3. After filling in the environment variables, click the **Create** button to start the deployment.

### Local Development

1. Create a `.env` file and configure the variables:

```env
# Database connection string
DATABASE_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_URL_HERE
# Used to encrypt JWT tokens. This should be a long, unguessable, strong password. You can use a password manager to generate one.
PAYLOAD_SECRET=YOUR_PAYLOAD_SECRET_HERE
# Used to configure CORS, format links, and more. No trailing slash.
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
# Used to validate preview requests
PREVIEW_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_HERE
# S3 Storage Configuratio, Storage of uploaded files
S3_BUCKET=xxx
S3_REGION=xxx
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx
S3_ENDPOINT=xxx
```

2. `pnpm install && pnpm dev` to install dependencies and start the dev server
3. open `http://localhost:3000` to open the app in your browser

### How it works
The Payload config is tailored specifically to the needs of most websites. It is pre-configured in the following ways:

#### Collections

See the [Collections](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections) docs for details on how to extend this functionality.

- ##### Users (Authentication)

  Users are auth-enabled collections that have access to the admin panel and unpublished content. See [Access Control](#access-control) for more details.

  For additional help, see the official [Auth Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/auth) or the [Authentication](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/overview#authentication-overview) docs.

- ##### Posts

  Posts are used to generate blog posts, news articles, or any other type of content that is published over time. All posts are layout builder enabled so you can generate unique layouts for each post using layout-building blocks, see Layout Builder(#layout-builder) for more details. Posts are also draft-enabled so you can preview them before publishing them to your website.

- ##### Pages

  All pages are layout builder enabled so you can generate unique layouts for each page using layout-building blocks. Pages are also draft-enabled so you can preview them before publishing them to your website.

- ##### Media

  This is the uploads enabled collection used by pages, posts, and projects to contain media like images, videos, downloads, and other assets. It features pre-configured sizes, focal point and manual resizing to help you manage your pictures.

- ##### Categories

  A taxonomy used to group posts together. Categories can be nested inside of one another, for example "News > Technology". See the official [Payload Nested Docs Plugin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/nested-docs) for more details.

- ##### Forms & Form Submissions
  This template also pre-configured with the official [Form Builder Plugin](hhttps://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/form-builder). This plugin allows you to build and manage custom forms directly within the Admin Panel, all form submissions are stored directly in your database and are managed directly from the Admin Panel.

- ##### Redirects

  If you are migrating an existing site or moving content to a new URL, you can use the `redirects` collection to create a proper redirect from old URLs to new ones. This will ensure that proper request status codes are returned to search engines and that your users are not left with a broken link. This template comes pre-configured with the official [Payload Redirects Plugin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/redirects) for complete redirect control from the admin panel.

- ##### Search

  This template also pre-configured with the official [Payload Search Plugin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/search) to showcase how SSR search features can easily be implemented into Next.js with Payload.
  
#### Globals

See the [Globals](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/globals) docs for details on how to extend this functionality.

- `Header`

  The data required by the header on your front-end like nav links.

- `Footer`

  Same as above but for the footer of your site.

#### Access control

Basic access control is setup to limit access to various content based based on publishing status.

- `users`: Users can access the admin panel and create or edit content.
- `posts`: Everyone can access published posts, but only users can create, update, or delete them.
- `pages`: Everyone can access published pages, but only users can create, update, or delete them.

For more details on how to extend this functionality, see the [Payload Access Control](https://payloadcms.com/docs/access-control/overview#access-control) docs.
